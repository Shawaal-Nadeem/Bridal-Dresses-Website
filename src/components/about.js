        the usual yet most essential events of Baraat and Walima, weddings here
        in Pakistan consist of a series of pre-wedding events, including Maayoun
        and Mehndi.

      <h1 className="heading">Before Getting Started</h1>
      <p>
        Pre-wedding events, unlike their names, are still a very aspect of the
        wedding itself. These are a part of the tradition and demonstrate love
        and positive, warm vibes among the bride's and groom's families. With
        time, new events have been added to pre-wedding events among the
        upper-middle and elite class families. The most popular amongst the
        newly added events are Shendi and Shalima, causing an equal stir in the
        country.

        Foreigners are very interested in knowing whether Shendi and Shalima are
        a part of the Pakistani culture or are just trending. Well, the decision
        is always up to the couple and their families. We think these new events
        are just another excuse to spend some more time and have more fun with
        the loved ones on the occasions, as the new generations couldn't care
        less about customs and traditions.

        Greens and yellows are worn during Mehendi and Maayoun. Reds are
        preferred on Baraat, and lighter shades are worn at Walima. When it
        comes to make-up, it's fancy and pretty yet not over the top. Things are
        preferred to be kept relatively simple before the main event: Baraat.
        While you can always go for simple wedding dresses, but when it comes to
        Barat dress for bride, no one goes for a simple dress.
